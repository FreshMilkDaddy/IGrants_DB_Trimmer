IGrants_XML_Trimmer

First and foremost, this script is my first attempt at writing Python code. Frankly, I'm a bit surprised that it works. 

I welcome constructive criticism. 

This script removes *most* non-international grants from the grants.gov downloadable XML database, reformats due dates & currency for easier readability, removes garbage opps., i.e., the "this is a test, do not apply" opps, and adds hyperlinks to the OppNums for use in the HTML table on the USA grants website.

Updated for Grants.gov v2.0 XML on 2017.01.02
